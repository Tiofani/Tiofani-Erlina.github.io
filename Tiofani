<h3 align="center"> 私のプロフィール </h3>
<p> 	Hi! My name is Tiofani Erlina Saragih Garingging. But you can call me Tio or io or yo... I'm a 16th years old girl who was born on June 16th in Jakarta. When I was born I have a big birthmark on my cheek. When my mother and father saw  that birthmark, they were really shock. Because as you know, I'm a girl and a girl who has some strange birthmark will be bullied. ( at least that was that I knew). They planned to have some plasic surger on my face when I got much older. But fortunately, the birthmark gone. Wha a relief that I don't need have some plastic surgery on my face.</p>
<p>Well, I was born in a family that are both my parents, my older sister and my two younger brother. If you want to meet me (but not for terror), I lived in Grand Depok City residence Block I Number 12th, Depok. I live in a residence because my mom want some good environment for my grown. But actually I don't really like lived in a residence house because the neighbour is not really humble. I prefer living in a countr environment than modern like residence. But yeah I'm the kid:/. I'm an open person to be friend with anybody but they must be a good friend and not a bullyer tpe one. If you want to contact me, you can call me in 081317867872 or you can contact me via line in tiotetsu. Or if you want to leave a message for me you can send it to tioimperfectionist@gmail.com</p> 
<h4 align="center"> 私の趣味 </h4>
<p> Hmmm.... for hobby I love to drawing sooooooo muuuucccchhh... (hehehe;P) especiayll manga, surealism, and a half face picture. I like to listening to music and singing (of course :/). My favourite singers are Got7, BTS, RedVelvet, One Direction, Sam Smith, Pentatonix, and many more. From my favourite singer you can say that I'm a K-Popers but also western lover. And also I like to eat and cooking. In Got7 my bias is Choi Youngjae, the literal sunshine who have such amazing voice, and in BTS my bias is Kim Seokjin, the Mr. Worldwide Handsome.</p>
